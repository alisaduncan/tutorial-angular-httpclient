# TutorialAngularHttpclient

A working version of the application can be found at [https://alisaduncan.github.io/tutorial-angular-httpclient/](https://alisaduncan.github.io/tutorial-angular-httpclient/)


This project was an opportunity for me to play with Angular, RxJS, and Material. The app calls [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to retrieve users and POST a new user. The code contains examples on utilizing Angular's HttpClient and corresponding unit tests. Unit tests for the view have been disabled for now.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.
